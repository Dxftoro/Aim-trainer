# Aim trainer
Simple aim trainer that i made using C++ and OpenGL.

The main objective of this training is aiming on the target that appears on the screen and clicking it. Aim and click as fast as you can. The game will calculate the average time spent catching the target. You need to catch it 50 times to complete.

Here are 2 difficulity modes: **Easy and hard**. You can select any of it. Difficulity level only changes size of the target, so on **Easy** mode it will be bigger than on **Hard** that makes it easier to aim and catch.
